							<h2>  United States - a combination of silence and driving </h2>
							<p>So as you understood I chose to make my trip to the United States. I got the idea for the trip one day at my previous job as a security worker at one of the land crossings in Israel, I looked at passersby and out of nowhere the thought occurred to me of why don't I take a car and just travel in another country.

<br>Then I started asking myself questions, which country I wanted to travel to, how long, the type of trip. In the end, I decided that, depending on the schedule and options I had, it was best to travel in the western United States, rent a car and travel for a month and a half, alone.

							<h2>My preparations for a trip to the United States </h2>
							<p>I started preparing for the trip only a month and a half before the trip, since it was only on that date that I realized that I would be able to fly. In the days leading up to the trip, in the weeks leading up to it, I was on active reserve duty in the southern Gaza Strip and the Eshkol Regional Council, so I couldn't start planning until I knew the estimated release date. After I understood the release date, I spoke with Shoham Yosef, the professional tour planner I had helped, and we started planning the trip, and i also started coordinating expectations and mentally preparing myself for the trip.

							<h2>The course of the trip</h2>
							<p>The trip began on March 3, 2024 at Ben Gurion Airport, an El Al flight to Los Angeles, from where I rented a car and drove to San Diego. In San Diego, an amazing city, I have been to a number of museums and attractions that interested me a lot.
</p>
<p> From San Diego I continued to Phoenix, where I stayed one night and after that I continued to an amazing town called Sedona, Sedona is a town between Phoenix and the Grand Canyon and is one of the most beautiful towns in my opinion in the United States, with breathtaking desert nature, from where I continued to Grand Canyon National Park.

</p>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park is undoubtedly a wonder â€“ what interested me in the park is not the nature and the end result, but more the process of how the park was actually created, and what its history is. After the Grand Canyon I continued to a town called Page, an Indian town, where I visited its nature on the Colorado River, after visiting the town for a few days and after exhausting its nature I continued to the town of Moab.

 </p>
 <p> Near Moab there are two national parks, I visited Arches National Park for a whole day and a quick visit to Canyonlands National Park, I was very impressed by their impressive nature.<br> On the last day in Moab I started a very long drive, crossed Capitol Reef National Park, reached a town called Torrey where I was supposed to spend the night. After self-evaluating the situation, I realized that I didn't want to spend the night in this town, which made me drive to my next destination, Bryce Canyon National Park.

</p>
<p> I really liked Bryce Canyon National Park, but the road to it was very challenging and long, the place is very beautiful with lots of snow, a refreshing change because Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon National Parks had a very significant landscape change for me.
<br>After finishing my visit to Bryce Canyon National Park, I continued my drive towards Zion National Park, where I was positively impressed by the beautiful scenery and relaxed atmosphere, in total I was there for 2 nights and continued to Las Vegas.


</p>
<p>In Las Vegas my experience was the best during the trip, the feeling in Vegas was very positive and liberating, even for people like me who don't like gambling and parties. In Vegas I also got to know more Israelis which gave me a feeling of home, I left Las Vegas after about 5 very significant nights, and continued towards Yosemite National Park.

 </p>
 <p>Unfortunately I didn't see much of Yosemite National Park but from what I saw I can attest that this is one of the most beautiful places i saw during the trip.<br>After finishing my visit to Yosemite National Park I went to San Francisco, to be honest San Francisco was a big part of my concerns leading up to the trip, what I heard about the city was not good. I'm glad I didn't give up on it because it's one of the most beautiful cities I've been to, breathtaking urban nature and one of the most beautiful cities with the best atmosphere in the United States, from where I continued my drive on Route 1.

 </p>
 <p> The trip on Route 1 was very experiential for me and I had a lot of fun driving along the West Coast, and visiting the towns along the way, I got back to Los Angeles, returned the car and prepared for the return home, and of course I toured Los Angeles.

</p>
<p> On Monday, April 8, 2024, I took off back to Israel and rested safely at Ben Gurion Airport.

							<h2>Trip summary</h2>
							<p> I went on the trip with a certain number of concerns, and except for the trip plan in its practicality I had no personal goal that goes beyond the trip, I am glad that I got to experience many things personally and that I gathered a lot of experiences among myself.

<br> On the trip I learned a lot about myself, I learned what the good character traits are, the bad ones, and how I don't change, but simply become an upgraded Shapiro.
